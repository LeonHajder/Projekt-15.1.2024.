			<h2>2023 Honda Civic Type R</h2>
			<p class="description">The 2023 Honda Civic Type R's styling is dialed back compared with its wildly designed predecessor, but that doesn't keep it from being more exciting to drive.</p>
			<p>Offered as a hatchback only, the Civic Type R is built from the more civilized 11th-generation Civic, which is reviewed separately. </p>
			<p>The new-generation Civic Type R uses the same turbocharged four-cylinder as the last model but with output dialed up to 315 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque.</p>
			<p>The front-wheel-drive Type R's six-speed manual transmission has also been upgraded to handle the power increase, and Honda has improved brake cooling to help handle track-day punishment.</p>
			<p>The new CTR is built in Japan with a powertrain from Ohio, but it's fun to drive everywhere in between. </p>
			<p>We were so impressed with the new Civic Type R that we named it to our 2023 10Best cars list.</p>
			<p>Honda's hottest new hatch aims to provide the same entertainment the last car did but with more power and smoother looks this time around.</p>
			<p>The new CTR's muscles have grown into a larger chassis, but it stands on smaller 19-inch wheels wrapped in wider Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires.</p>
			<p>The front and rear tracks are also wider with improved cooling for the brakes.</p>
			<p>The CTR's output gains nine horsepower and 15 pound-feet of torque from an upgraded 315-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter engine and six-speed manual transmission.</p>
			<p>The Type R's onboard datalogger no longer requires a smartphone app, as its lap recording and performance instrumentation can now be accessed from the car's 9.0-inch infotainment touchscreen.</p>
			<p>The Honda Civic Type R's starting price is as competitive as its performance. With few options to tack on beyond its initial MSRP, the CTR is not only cheaper than the Volkswagen Golf R, but it's also nearly at the price of the entry-level Toyota Supra.</p>
			<p>While personal preference will define if two seats are better than four, the most powerful Civic Type R is ultimately an affordable sports car with five doors.</p>
