			<h2>Old Vs New: Honda Civic Type-R Side By Side Changes Explained</h2>
			<p class="description">While Honda has only released a few pictures of the exterior and interior, with the technical details yet to come, these pictures are enough to say that Honda has upped its game with the new model. That is a solid first impression to begin with!</p>
			<p>While the new Civic Type-R looks sporty, it is not that sort of attention-screamer as the previous-gen model, thus making the new one look less aggressive.</p>
			<p>In the transformation process, the new Honda Civic Type-R receives a leaner and wider-looking face. The headlamps and front grille have become slimmer. And while the air dam in the middle of the front bumper is wider-looking than before, the rest of the bumper has a cleaner look with no sporty-looking fog lamp housings this time. </p>
			<p>The rear profile of the previous-generation Honda Civic Type-R looked menacing with those boomerang-shaped LED tail lamps, large mesh sections with black trims on the sides of the rear bumper, twin wing setup, and tiny spoilers on either side of the roof. </p>
			<p>All-in-all, the previous-generation Honda Civic Type-R gave all the good reasons to other by-passers to pay keener attention ahead after overtaking them.</p>
			<p>When you compare the layouts of the interior of both versions of the Civic Type-R, you will instantly feel how minimalist and cleaner the interior of the new version looks in comparison to the visual bulk of the previous model.</p>
			<p>Here, the sportiness is somehow balanced in both the iterations of the Civic Type-R, as the newer model also has plenty of redness in its seat, door pad inserts, and floor.</p>
			<p>All-in-all, the sportiness in the new Honda Civic Type-R looks a bit toned down compared to the previous-gen model, especially on the outside. </p>
			<p>However, the cabin in the new model certainly looks flashier and more modern without compromising on the sportiness. Now, all the world’s attention has come to Honda’s claim that the new model is faster than before.</p>
