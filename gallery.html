			<p>The first Civic to receive the Type R badge was introduced on August 19, 1997, as the EK9. 
			   The EK9 shared many characteristics with the Integra Type R DC2/JDM DB8 such as omission of sound deadening and other weight reduction measures, a hand-ported 1.6-litre DOHC VTEC B16B 4-cylinder engine, front-helical limited-slip differential and a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission. </p>

				<p>In 2001, Honda introduced the next generation of the Civic Type R as a unique 3-door hatchback to the UK market, which was manufactured in Swindon, England. 
				   This European Domestic Market Civic Type R featured a 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp) 2.0-liter i-VTEC engine (K20A2) and the regular Type R treatment of seam welding, close-ratio 6-speed transmission and upgraded brakes, but did not include some of the other higher-end features such as the helical limited-slip differential and red Recaro race seats that were standard on the EK9.</p>

			<p>The European and international market Civic Type R is offered only as a three-door hatchback and uses a different chassis and internal layout (notably tank placement below the driver's seat), which will serve as the base for the next European version of the Jazz. The rear suspension, formerly a double wishbone setup, was changed to a less complex torsion beam axle. 
			   The drive train is largely the same as the predecessor, offering 201 PS (148 kW; 198 hp) at 7,800 rpm and 193 N⋅m (142 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,600 rpm,[23] with 90 percent of peak torque is available from 2,500 rpm.</p>

			<p>The FK2 Civic Type R is powered by the K20C1 Direct Fuel Injection 1,996 cc (2.0 L; 121.8 cu in) turbocharged Inline-four engine with Earth Dreams Technology, having a power output of 310 PS (228 kW; 306 hp) at 6,500 rpm and maximum torque of 400 N⋅m (295 lb⋅ft) at 2,500–4,500 rpm.</p>

			<p>The FK8 Civic Type R uses the same engine as its predecessor, a turbocharged inline-four with increased power to 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) in the European and Japanese version but remains the same 310 PS (228 kW; 306 hp) in other markets. 
				The engine is mated to a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission continuing the tradition of its predecessors with limited-slip differential as standard.</p>

			<p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine is carried over from the previous generation with incremental changes such as a revised turbocharger that features a more compact housing to improve the overall unit efficiency. 
				The turbine itself has had both its blade count and shape optimized to boost power and improve airflow.</p>

			<p>Mugen doesn’t like turbos, so the naturally aspirated 2.0-litre engine with a new red line of 8,600rpm has had to be extensively retuned to generate the 237bhp and 157lb ft. that’s 39bhp over the normal Type R. 
				You’ll also find stiffer suspension on this type R, and the Mugen Civic has spent a fair amount of time in Honda’s wind tunnel to get all those scoops and that faintly ridiculous rear wing working properly.</p>
